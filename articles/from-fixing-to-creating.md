   If your life is all about solving problems, youâ€™ll need endless problems.
   Shift to pursuing activities that are meaningful in themselves.

If all your activities are about fixing problems, filling needs, and resolving
pain, then your life requires problems, needs, pain, and conflict. If instead
you pursue things meaningful in themselves, with an intrinsic joy, then the good
life is more easily achieved.

Move from a reactive mindset ("What needs fixing?") to a generative one ("What
do I love creating?").
