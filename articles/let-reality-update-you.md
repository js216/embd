   When your ideas clash with reality, it’s your ideas that must change. Release
   fixed notions that no longer fit.

Reality always makes sense because it is reality. When our ideas of it do not
correspond to it, it's the ideas that are suspect.

Insofar as our understanding involves a mapping of the fluid reality to fixed
ideas, we will always end up confused when refusing to let go of fixed ideas
that have lost their relevance.

Staying flexible in thought is a form of mental hygiene.
