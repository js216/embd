#### Places and people

Mentioned in the Preface:

- Desert of Scete (*heremo Sciti*) is an hour and a half drive northwest from
  Cairo. It "became one of Christianity's most sacred areas" (Wikipedia),
  presumably because of the abbots mentioned in these Conferences.

- John Cassian, lived about 360--435, spent decades in the Middle East.

- Germanus, Cassian's best friend, traveled with him in Palestine.

- Blessed Pope Castor (*beatissimo papae Castori*), mentioned in the Preface,
  refers to [Castor of Apt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castor_of_Apt), who
  was the bishop of Apt (southern France).

- Blessed Pope Leontius (*beatissime papa Leonti*).

- Holy brother Helladius (*sancte frater Helladi*).

#### Things better and things worse

Also from the Preface:

- **Better*: Helladius followed the sublime customs of the Anchorites
  (*anachoretarum instituta sublimia*) from their traditions (*illorum
  traditionibus*)

  **Worse**: Like some others, presumptuously on his own account (*non ut
  quidam propria adgressus est praesumptione sectari*); from his own ideas
  (*suis adinventionibus*).

- Anchorite's life is grander than that of the Coenobium; contemplation of
  God [...] more sublime than ordinary practical life (*a coenobiis
  anachoresis et ab actuali uita [...] maior actuque sublimior est*)

#### Scopon vs telos

In Chapter II of Conference I (hereafter I:II) we find the distinction,
supposedly made by "Abbot Moses", between two kinds of goals. All arts and
sciences (*omnes artes ac disciplinae*) have two kinds of purposes:

- Goal or mark (*scopon, id est destinationem*). Compare σκοπός: goal, aim,
  desired result. Without the target goal you can't even know how wrong you've
  gotten. Traveling in the wrong direction you get all the trouble and get none
  of the good of the journey.

  - Purity of heart (*puritas cordis*)
  - Sanctification

- Ultimate end or aim (*telos, hoc est finem proprium*). Compare τέλος: aim,
  purpose, end goal, design.

  - Kingdom of heaven --- regnum caelorum
  - Eternal life --- vita aeterna
  - Heavenly prize --- finem caelestis

#### Strange practices

At the end of the same chapter (I:II) we find an enumeration of strange
practices which are done "for the sake of the kingdom of heaven" (I:III). These
are done with some perverse joy, even though Cassian was well aware that most
people would find these things unpleasant:

- Want of food in fasting --- ieiuniorum inedia
- Weariness of vigils --- vigiliarum lassitudo
- Reading and constant meditation on the Scriptures --- lectio ac meditatio
  scripturarum continuata
- Incessant toil --- labor incessabilis
- Nudity --- nuditas (rendered in the translation as "self-denial", why?)
- Self-denial and privation of all things --- nuditasque et omnium rerum
  priuatio
- Horrors of this vast desert --- horror huius vastissimae solitudinis

At a first glance, this is pure, undisguised spiritual showing off. Indeed, I:I
says that Abbot Moses was reluctant to say anything on the matter lest "he might
appear to lay himself open either to the charge of bragging" (*iactantia*).

### Few things, one thing

According to Cassian, the Lord of the gospel of St. Luke has declared that:

> "few things" are needful for perfect bliss, i.e., that contemplation which is
> first secured by reflecting on a few saints: from the contemplation of whom,
> he who has made some progress rises and attains by God's help to that which is
> termed "one thing," i.e., the consideration of God alone [I:VIII]

It's not clear to me at this point whether the Lord does really advocate the
contemplation of saints at any point in any of the scriptures. St. Paul comes
closest, saying "Be ye followers of me, even as I also am of Christ" (1 Cor
11:1).

### Saints are special

The Preface warns that we may come across, in these Conferences, things that may
appear impossible or very difficult (*vel inpossibilia putaverit esse vel
dura*). They are to be explained by

- the worth and perfection of the speakers (dead to worldly life, no feelings
  for their kinsmen, no ties of worldly occupations)
- the character of the vast desert in which they dwelt, cut off from intercourse
  with all their fellow-men

The really judge it properly, we should try living in the same way:

> But if any one wants to give a true opinion on this matter, and is anxious to
> try whether such perfection can be attained, let him first endeavour to make
> his purpose their own, with the same zeal and the same mode of life, and then
> in the end he will find that those things which used to seem beyond the powers
> of men, are not only possible, but really delightful.

### Always on Him?

In I:XIII we get advice that seems to go directly against the contemplation of
Saints idea we saw above: "even a momentary departure from gazing on Christ is
fornication" (*fornicatio:* fornication, whoredom, prostitution). Thus the mind,
when distracted from its correct focus, should acknowledge the lapse and return
to Christ.

### Two kinds of joy

Sometimes the phrase "kingdom of God" refers to some eschatological final
condition (i.e., heavens). But in I:XIII things are more down to earth, so to
speak:

> the actual kingdom of God is righteousness and peace and joy, then the man who
> abides in these is most certainly in the kingdom of God, and on the contrary
> those who live in unrighteousness, and discord, and the sorrow that worketh
> death, have their place in the kingdom of the devil, and in hell and death.

But not all kinds of joy would do:

> the holy Apostle does not say generally or without qualification that every
> joy is the kingdom of God, but markedly and emphatically that joy alone which
> is "in the Holy Ghost." For he was perfectly aware of another detestable joy,
> of which we hear "the world shall rejoice," and "woe unto you that laugh, for
> ye shall mourn."

### Meditation on God

The idea of constant focus on the highest Good, or meditation on the true Way,
is of considerable interest to me as it appears to be a simple, direct answer to
the big questions of life: What to do, and why? Unfortunately it's a case of
"easier said than done". First of all, what does it even mean to say a thing
like always gaze on the Christ, all else is whoredom? Cassian admits that
there's no one answer. In I:XV, we get a whole enumeration of the variety of
ways to contemplate God (edited for length):

- Admiring His incomprehensible essence
- Through the greatness of His creation
- Consideration of His justice
- Contemplate what He has done with His saints in every generation
- his power with which He governs, directs, and rules all things
- The vastness of His knowledge
- Consider the sand of the sea, and the number of the waves
- Think that the drops of rain, the days and hours of the ages, and all things
  past and future are present to His knowledge
- Gaze in unbounded admiration on that ineffable mercy of His, which with
  unwearied patience endures countless sins which are every moment being
  committed under His very eyes
- The numberless opportunities of salvation which He grants to those whom He is
  going to adopt
- That He made us be born in such a way as that from our very cradles His grace
  and the knowledge of His law might be given to us
- His undertaking the dispensation of His Incarnation for our salvation
- Numberless other considerations of this sort

A fine list of meditations! At the end, the flow of language carries Cassian
away into an argument not entirely logical:

> These considerations certainly no one will preserve lastingly, if anything of
> carnal affections still survives in him, because "thou canst not," saith the
> Lord, "see My face: for no man shall see Me and live;" viz., to this world and
> to earthly affections.

The reference is to Exodus 33:20, where God is speaking to Moses right after
threatening to destroy Israel because of the golden calf incident. Moses asks
God, in a bit of a non sequitur, to show his glory, and God refuses for Moses
would not be able to live in such a case. But Cassian makes a claim that goes
beyond what seems reasonable: it's perfectly fine to see God, so long as you are
dead to the world and earthly affections.

That's also a point where I lose interest, since speculating on after-death
experience is no part of my job description.
