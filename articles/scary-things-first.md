This morning it occurred to me that I'm really not looking forward to going to
the office, for I'll have to continue doing something that I spent two days on
already, and it's still not working. I can easily think of many other such
things that I'd rather not do, and as it happens each of them comes with a
"positive", or attractive aspect (written in brackets):

- Going out to meet someone, despite being tired after work (but enjoying the
  company of a really nice person with a different perspective on life)
- Having to separate from loved ones when time comes (but being happy to
  be with them for now)
- Dying (but being being alive)

These are generalized examples; my real list is longer and more specific, but I
won't bore you with the details since anyone can easily write down their own,
personally relevant version.

The point of these contrasts is not so much that the "bad" part of the stick is
to be borne because the "good" part is worth so much more. The point is not even
to try and forget about the bad part by various means (distraction, expression,
repression, suppression), even though that's what I end up doing most of the
time. The point is to try and see them as a single "yin-yang" unit: black in
white, white in black.

These contrasts are inevitable, so why waste time fighting them, denying their
existence? Relax into the reality, let go of the fear and dread by feeling it
directly until your brain gets tired of it. I'm not saying, "stop fearing the
inevitable", as the fear itself is in fact part of the inevitable. The lake
would not try to hide its waves when a stone is thrown into it; its waves
radiate outwards until they stop. In fact they never really stop, so the lake
does not reject them.

Somewhere in the Tao Te Ching it is said that the great power of water (wearing
down mountains, etc.) is because it's not loath to take the lowest, humblest
part, where no one wants to be. Elsewhere there's the image of the malformed
tree surviving, while the straight, useful ones are cut down for the carpenter.
I wonder if peace can be had in the face of the above mentioned "dreadful"
future situations by sinking, in each of them, to the most dreadful point.
Assume the most broken, useless mental state: be angry and sad, afraid and
trembling, and watch things come and go. Strength in weakness?

On a practical note: each day, do the "dreadful" thing first to avoid wasting
too much time and effort doing pointless other things. Looking back, avoidance
behaviors are often much more exhausting than what they supposedly protect me
from. Or, in someone's wise words: "Procrastination is not worth the time it
takes."
