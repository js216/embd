Unix was built on a handful of ideas that turned out to be both powerful and
practical. The following discussion blends established Unix facts with
interpretive commentary; it does not claim to describe any single historical
Unix precisely.

### Programs and the Shell

The shell runs commands as programs. There's no special class of built-ins; if
you want a new command, you write a program. By default, programs read from
standard input and write to standard output, unless redirected.

Most commands are small filters for text streams. They do one job, and they work
together naturally. Connecting them with pipes lets you build bigger tools out
of simpler ones.

### The File System Abstraction

Everything is a file: user data, programs, directories, and even devices.
Directories form a tree; each entry points to an inode, which knows where the
data blocks live. Devices show up as files too.

This means that I/O and storage use the same calls: open, close, read, write.
That's the interface for everything. Executables and data files are stored in
the same way, reinforcing the idea that a single abstraction suffices.

### Processes and the Kernel

The kernel is deliberately small. It multiplexes I/O and leaves the rest to user
programs. Even init, the first process, is just a program: it opens terminals,
prints the login message, and starts shells in a loop.

Processes come from the fork/exec pair. One process copies itself, then overlays
the copy with another program. The idea is simple, and it works.

System calls are invoked by a trap instruction, wrapped in library functions so
programs don't depend directly on kernel details. Programs stay independent, and
the operating system can change underneath.

### Small, Understandable, Portable

Unix was small enough that one person could understand the whole thing. That
made it easier to modify, port, and teach. The manuals were short, consistent,
and focused on usage, not internals. A second volume provided tutorials and
background for those who wanted more.

The guiding principle was: be general, but not too general; portable, but not
too portable. If you try to solve every problem in advance, you get bloat. By
keeping it modest, Unix was more useful---and paradoxically more general and
portable---than larger systems.

### The 80/20 Rule

Some parts were machine-specific, usually device drivers or bits of assembly.
But not many. Most code was reusable, and the exceptions were small. An array of
function pointers mapped device numbers to driver routines; that was about as
complex as it got. For example, a character device[^devsw] driver needs to
expose the following functions:

```c
extern struct cdevsw
{
	int	(*d_open)();
	int	(*d_close)();
	int	(*d_read)();
	int	(*d_write)();
	int	(*d_ioctl)();
	int	(*d_stop)();
	struct tty *d_ttys;
} cdevsw[];
```

The 80/20 rule applied everywhere: make most of the system simple and portable,
accept a little complexity when it really pays off. Code was meant to be 80%
reusable, not 100%, which avoided the kind of rigidity seen in later systems.

### Self-Hosting and Accessible

Unix came with all its own sources and tools. It was self-hosting, and people
could read, study, and change the code. The system included what you needed, and
nothing more. No useless programs, no dead code, and very little irrelevant
platform-specific clutter.

The philosophy was to write programs you would actually use, not ones meant to
satisfy a standard or some hypothetical future need.

### Simplicity Above All

The enduring lesson of Unix is that simplicity beats complexity. Interfaces were
orthogonal, text was the universal medium, and programs were small and
self-contained. Each one did one thing, and did it well.

That philosophy proved more important than any single feature. It made Unix
portable, teachable, and durable. It showed that you don't need a committee or a
grand design to build something powerful. You need clarity, restraint, and the
discipline to write only what you need.

### Reflections and Extensions

Unix also suggests how to go further. Small, portable, self-contained programs
can approach the kind of stability that TeX achieved---systems so refined that
they don't need to change.

Portability itself can be modular. The Wollongong group[^wol] showed this by first
porting Unix piece by piece to an Interdata 7/32, running it alongside the host
system, and then replacing the host functions with assembly routines. That
approach points toward kernels that are more modular, where pieces like fork and
exec could be reused without bringing along a whole scheduler.

Device drivers can also be simplified. One idea is to treat them as user
processes whose IDs match their device numbers. They would implement the usual
open, read, and write interfaces, but otherwise behave like ordinary programs:
start and stop freely, hold their own memory, receive signals. The kernel would
not "manage" them, yet the familiar Unix file interface would still apply.

The same lesson holds today. Artificial intelligence can sometimes repair or
adapt programs automatically, but only if the systems are small and
self-contained. Large, tangled software offers no foothold. Unix worked because
it avoided dead code, avoided over-abstraction, and made each interface simple
enough to understand and replace.

Finally, Unix showed that the way forward can't be too innovative. *If "the way"
is too radical, no one will follow it.*[^rad] The genius of Unix was that it was
just radical enough.
