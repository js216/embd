- quantifying software efficiency: normally it's defined as effect divided by
  energy in, but in software there's only emotional vague terms like
  "lightweight" and "fast"; why not put software on a per-joule basis as well?
- can we return to the software tools philosophy, where programs are small and
  modular, and the documentation tells how to turn it into a turnkey solution,
  so you can read the docs to know how to use the programs instead of having to
  read the millions of lines of source code of some useless turnkey demos to
  understand how the documentation is supposed to work?
- some thoughts, perhaps the best ones, are fragile, diaphanous, and easily
  wiped out by distractions: big colored buttons, social pressures, etc., that's
  why meditation is great, or restricted environemnts (command line, Freewrite
  Alpha)
- Describe my "agile for one" system, and what I've learned and what I'm trying
  now
- What It Can Do and What It Can't Do: the tension between people who start by
  pointing out all the things that are wrong with a {tool, philosophy,
  religion}, and those who acknowledge limitations and proceed to make the most
  of the possibility (quote by Ford: "Whether you believe you can do a thing or
  not, you are right."). Examples: AI agents, LLMs, Osho philosophy, embedded
  Linux, "computers will never" mentality. Contrast between (useless) spending
  of time looking for reasons why the thing cannot work, instead of spending the
  same time and effort looking for reasons it can work, and applications in
  which it can do the most good.
- Tracing my Unix obsession: it started with Bach
- Write a response piece to my LLM article, Why I Need Humans, incl. experience,
  building something together, opportunity to help ala Seneca "why sage needs a
  friend"
- you cannot fall behind if you think of things to do in terms of a single
  simple flat list, like in my "agile for one", but if you think of it as a
  calendar, as things you have to do on a particular day, then yes of course
  things can move on faster than you can process them
- explain #include DAG analyzer, and mention how ST thinks #includes are a
  nuisance and packages them all in to a single "God header", but they are a
  very important and intentional part of the C language design, since they bring
  out the dependencies in a program in a very clear, machine analyzable way
  (e.g. my Python script), and the point of "include what you use" is to reduce
  accidental complexity by reducing coupling between layers/modules/parts of the
  program

- why are you so afraid of AI scrapers? isn't that the best way to serve the
  most people? let go of your monetization schemes, they're after all what made
  the web so awful in 2010-2020s.
- forms of "negativity" (cf. Alan Watts TV programme): morning meditation with
  coffee, sleep, listening to "pure" music, silent church meditation of with
  perfectly predictable liturgy (tridentine rite), hiking without talking (cf.
  James Clear book about Abraham Lincoln retreating into silence, away from
  other people's words), having tea or alcohol in the evening without
  talking/reading/watching; compare with modern excuses about holiness in the
  midst of activity (Escriva, etc.); go, flying, biking, doing dishes ... really
  an activity with sole focus, no distractions, no peoplecrashing in, no keeping
  of a mental stack of things to do next/after; case study: Linus repeatedly
  writes how he did Linux because he had nothing else to do; but why so much
  self-deprecation? The amazing focus he had is a rare thing, much to be
  marvelled
