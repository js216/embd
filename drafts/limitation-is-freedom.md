   Doing less allows you to accomplish more. True productivity comes from
   narrowing your focus and releasing unnecessary goals.

Limitation is the only way to get anything done. The less one aims to do, the
more gets done. By the time the aim becomes to do nothing at all, everything is
accomplished.

On a practical level, trying to do too many things at once results in not having
enough time for any single one of them. Thus the paradox: the less one is trying
to do, the more gets done. At any rate, it's impossible to do more than one
thing at a time. The closer one approaches to the ideal of unity, the more
efficient the work becomes. Distraction is dissipation; limitation is focus.

This is not a moral statement but a practical one: limitations free your energy
for what matters.
