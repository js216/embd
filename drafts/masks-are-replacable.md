   Weâ€™re never stuck with the same identity forever. Each role can be shed and
   regrown.

There are some animals, as well as most plants, that can grow back a lost limb.
Humans are like that in relation to the mask we wear. As soon as we take off a
mask, we begin to grow another one.

When refusing to play a role, one is merely playing a different role.
Nevertheless, this means that one is not stuck with the same role forever; it's
only a matter of reading a new job description, learning the new skills
required, and assuming the new behaviors.

Identity is a tool, not a prison.
