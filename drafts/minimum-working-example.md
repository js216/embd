   Keep projects as simple as possible. Stop inventing new rules and build only

When the rules of a game are simple, don't keep inventing new rules to
complicate things. In particular, at all levels an engineering project needs to
be as simple as possible while still functioning as expected. Beyond that, leave
all rules behind.

Indeed, there is only one rule: the thing has to work. Besides, the less time
and effort spent in the implementation, the more there is left for interesting
applications. In sum, always only make the minimum working example.
