<h2>Failure Is Not Personal</h2>

<p>In a probabilistic world, it is unreasonable to expect any one thing to succeed.
At most, you can hope that of the several that were attempted, at least one will
turn out as expected. That&rsquo;s the genetic algorithm: try a countless number of
things, and remember which ones work and which ones don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing personal about things that fail&mdash;or, for that matter, those
that succeed. It is just the unfolding of a complex system, so better not be
attached to any one outcome.</p>
<p>Success and failure are signals, not verdicts on your worth.</p>
