<h2>LLM problems observed in humans</h2>
<div class="article-meta">Published 7 Jan 2026. By Jakob Kastelic.</div>
<p><img src="../images/brain.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>While some are still discussing why computers will never be able to pass the
Turing test, I find myself repeatedly facing the idea that as the models improve
and humans don&rsquo;t, the bar for the test gets raised and eventually humans won&rsquo;t
pass the test themselves. Here&rsquo;s a list of what used to be LLM failure modes but
that are now more commonly observed when talking to people.</p>
<h3 id="dont-know-when-to-stop-generating">Don&rsquo;t know when to stop generating</h3>
<p>This has always been an issue in conversations: you ask a seemingly small and
limited question, and in return have to listen to what seems like hours of
incoherent rambling. Despite exhausting their knowledge of the topic, people
will keep on talking about stuff you have no interest in. I find myself
searching for the &ldquo;stop generating&rdquo; button, only to remember that all I can do
is drop hints, or rudely walk away.</p>
<h3 id="small-context-window">Small context window</h3>
<p>The best thing about a good deep conversation is when the other person gets you:
you explain a complicated situation you find yourself in, and find some
resonance in their replies. That, at least, is what happens when chatting with
the recent large models. But when subjecting the limited human mind to the same
prompt&mdash;a rather long one&mdash;again and again the information in the prompt
somehow gets lost, their focus drifts away, and you have to repeat crucial
facts. In such a case, my gut reaction is to see if there&rsquo;s a way to pay to
upgrade to a bigger model, only to remember that there&rsquo;s no upgrading of the
human brain. At most what you can do is give them a good night&rsquo;s sleep and then
they may possibly switch from the &ldquo;Fast&rdquo; to the &ldquo;Thinking&rdquo; mode, but that&rsquo;s not
guaranteed with all people.</p>
<h3 id="too-narrow-training-set">Too narrow training set</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got a lot of interests and on any given day, I may be excited to discuss
various topics, from kernels to music to cultures and religions. I know I can
put together a prompt to give any of today&rsquo;s leading models and am essentially
guaranteed a fresh perspective on the topic of interest. But let me pose the
same prompt to people and more often then not the reply will be a polite nod
accompanied by clear signs of their thinking something else entirely, or maybe
just a summary of the prompt itself, or vague general statements about how
things should be. In fact, so rare it is to find someone who knows what I mean
that it feels like a magic moment. With the proliferation of genuinely good
models&mdash;well educated, as it were&mdash;finding a conversational partner with a
good foundation of shared knowledge has become trivial with AI. This does not
bode well for my interest in meeting new people.</p>
<h3 id="repeating-the-same-mistakes">Repeating the same mistakes</h3>
<p>Models with a small context window, or a small number of parameters, seem to
have a hard time learning from their mistakes. This should not be a problem for
humans: we have a long term memory span measured in decades, with emotional
reinforcement of the most crucial memories. And yet, it happens all too often
that I must point out the same logical fallacy again and again in the same
conversation! Surely, I think, if I point out the mistake in the reasoning, this
will count as an important correction that the brain should immediately make use
of? As it turns out, there seems to be some kind of a fundamental limitation on
how quickly the neural connections can get rewired. Chatting with recent models,
who can make use the extra information immediately, has deteriorated my patience
regarding having to repeat myself.</p>
<h3 id="failure-to-generalize">Failure to generalize</h3>
<p>By this point, it&rsquo;s possible to explain what happens in a given situation, and
watch the model apply the lessons learned to a similar situation. Not so with
humans. When I point out that the same principles would apply elsewhere, their
response will be somewhere along the spectrum of total bafflement on the one end
and on the other, a face-saving explanation that the comparison doesn&rsquo;t apply
&ldquo;because it&rsquo;s different&rdquo;. Indeed the whole point of comparisons is to apply same
principles in different situations, so why the excuse? I&rsquo;ve learned to take up
such discussions with AI and not trouble people with them.</p>
<h3 id="failure-to-apply-to-specific-situation">Failure to apply to specific situation</h3>
<p>This is the opposite issue: given a principle stated in general terms, the
person will not be able to apply it in a specific situation. Indeed, I&rsquo;ve had a
lifetime of observing this very failure mode in myself: given the laws of
physics, which are typically &ldquo;obvious&rdquo; and easy to understand, I find it very
difficult to calculate how long before the next eclipse. More and more, rather
than think these things through myself, I&rsquo;d just send a quick prompt to the most
recent big model, and receive a good answer in seconds. In other words, models
threaten to sever me not only from other flawed humans, but from my own &ldquo;slow&rdquo;
thinking as well!</p>
<h3 id="persistent-hallucination">Persistent hallucination</h3>
<p>Understood in the medical sense, hallucination refers to when something appears
to be real even as you know very well it isn&rsquo;t. Having no direct insight into
the &ldquo;inner mental life&rdquo; of models, we claim that every false fact they spit out
is a form of hallucination. The meaning of the word is shifting from the medical
sense towards the direction of &ldquo;just being wrong, and persistently so&rdquo;. This has
plagued human speech for centuries. As a convenient example, look up some heated
debate between proponents of science and those of religion. (As if the two need
be in conflict!) When a model exhibits hallucination, often providing more
context and evidence will dispel it, but the same trick does not appear to work
so well on humans.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Where to go from here? One conclusion is that LLMs are damaging the connection
people feel with each other, much like a decade before social networks
threatened to destroy it by replacing it with a shallower, simulated versions.
Another interpretation would be to conclude cynically that it&rsquo;s time humans get
either enhanced or replaced by a more powerful form of intelligence. I&rsquo;d say
we&rsquo;re not there yet entirely, but that some of the replacement has been effected
already: I&rsquo;ll never again ask a human to write a computer program shorter than
about a thousand lines, since an LLM will do it better.</p>
<p>Indeed, why am I even writing this? I asked GPT-5 for additional failure modes
and found more additional examples than I could hope to get from a human:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Beyond the failure modes already discussed, humans also exhibit analogues of
several newer LLM pathologies: conversations often suffer from <strong>instruction
drift,</strong> where the original goal quietly decays as social momentum takes over;
<strong>mode collapse,</strong> in which people fall back on a small set of safe clichés
and conversational templates; and <strong>reward hacking,</strong> where social approval or
harmony is optimized at the expense of truth or usefulness. Humans frequently
<strong>overfit the prompt,</strong> responding to the literal wording rather than the
underlying intent, and display <strong>safety overrefusal,</strong> declining to engage
with reasonable questions to avoid social or reputational risk. Reasoning is
also marked by <strong>inconsistency across turns,</strong> with contradictions going
unnoticed, and by <strong>temperature instability,</strong> where fatigue, emotion, or
audience dramatically alters the quality and style of thought from one moment
to the next.</p>
