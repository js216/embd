<h2>Masks Are Replaceable</h2>

<p>There are some animals, as well as most plants, that can grow back a lost limb.
Humans are like that in relation to the mask we wear. As soon as we take off a
mask, we begin to grow another one.</p>
<p>When refusing to play a role, one is merely playing a different role.
Nevertheless, this means that one is not stuck with the same role forever; it&rsquo;s
only a matter of reading a new job description, learning the new skills
required, and assuming the new behaviors.</p>
<p>Identity is a tool, not a prison.</p>
