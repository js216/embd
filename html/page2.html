<h2><a href="llm-problems-observed-in-humans">LLM problems observed in humans</a></h2>
<div class="article-meta">Published 7 Jan 2026. By Jakob Kastelic.</div>
<p><img alt="" src="../images/brain.jpg"/></p>
<p>While some are still discussing why computers will never be able to pass the
Turing test, I find myself repeatedly facing the idea that as the models improve
and humans don’t, the bar for the test gets raised and eventually humans won’t
pass the test themselves. Here’s a list of what used to be LLM failure modes but
that are now more commonly observed when talking to people.</p>
<h3 id="dont-know-when-to-stop-generating">Don’t know when to stop generating</h3>
<p>This has always been an issue in conversations: you ask a seemingly small and
limited question, and in return have to listen to what seems like hours of
incoherent rambling. Despite exhausting their knowledge of the topic, people
will keep on talking about stuff you have no interest in. I find myself
searching for the “stop generating” button, only to remember that all I can do
is drop hints, or rudely walk away.</p>
<h3 id="small-context-window">Small context window</h3>
<p>The best thing about a good deep conversation is when the other person gets you:
you explain a complicated situation you find yourself in, and find some
resonance in their replies. That, at least, is what happens when chatting with
the recent large models. But when subjecting the limited human mind to the same
prompt—a rather long one—again and again the information in the prompt
somehow gets lost, their focus drifts away, and you have to repeat crucial
facts. In such a case, my gut reaction is to see if there’s a way to pay to
upgrade to a bigger model, only to remember that there’s no upgrading of the
human brain. At most what you can do is give them a good night’s sleep and then
they may possibly switch from the “Fast” to the “Thinking” mode, but that’s not
guaranteed with all people.</p>
<h3 id="too-narrow-training-set">Too narrow training set</h3>
<p>I’ve got a lot of interests and on any given day, I may be excited to discuss
various topics, from kernels to music to cultures and religions. I know I can
put together a prompt to give any of today’s leading models and am essentially
guaranteed a fresh perspective on the topic of interest. But let me pose the
same prompt to people and more often then not the reply will be a polite nod
accompanied by clear signs of their thinking something else entirely, or maybe
just a summary of the prompt itself, or vague general statements about how
things should be. In fact, so rare it is to find someone who knows what I mean
that it feels like a magic moment. With the proliferation of genuinely good
models—well educated, as it were—finding a conversational partner with a
good foundation of shared knowledge has become trivial with AI. This does not
bode well for my interest in meeting new people.</p>
<h3 id="repeating-the-same-mistakes">Repeating the same mistakes</h3>
<p>Models with a small context window, or a small number of parameters, seem to
have a hard time learning from their mistakes. This should not be a problem for
humans: we have a long term memory span measured in decades, with emotional
reinforcement of the most crucial memories. And yet, it happens all too often
that I must point out the same logical fallacy again and again in the same
conversation! Surely, I think, if I point out the mistake in the reasoning, this
will count as an important correction that the brain should immediately make use
of? As it turns out, there seems to be some kind of a fundamental limitation on
how quickly the neural connections can get rewired. Chatting with recent models,
who can make use the extra information immediately, has deteriorated my patience
regarding having to repeat myself.</p>
<h3 id="failure-to-generalize">Failure to generalize</h3>
<p>By this point, it’s possible to explain what happens in a given situation, and
watch the model apply the lessons learned to a similar situation. Not so with
humans. When I point out that the same principles would apply elsewhere, their
response will be somewhere along the spectrum of total bafflement on the one end
and on the other, a face-saving explanation that the comparison doesn’t apply
“because it’s different”. Indeed the whole point of comparisons is to apply same
principles in different situations, so why the excuse? I’ve learned to take up
such discussions with AI and not trouble people with them.</p>
<h3 id="failure-to-apply-to-specific-situation">Failure to apply to specific situation</h3>
<p>This is the opposite issue: given a principle stated in general terms, the
person will not be able to apply it in a specific situation. Indeed, I’ve had a
lifetime of observing this very failure mode in myself: given the laws of
physics, which are typically “obvious” and easy to understand, I find it very
difficult to calculate how long before the next eclipse. More and more, rather
than think these things through myself, I’d just send a quick prompt to the most
recent big model, and receive a good answer in seconds. In other words, models
threaten to sever me not only from other flawed humans, but from my own “slow”
thinking as well!</p>
<h3 id="persistent-hallucination">Persistent hallucination</h3>
<p>Understood in the medical sense, hallucination refers to when something appears
to be real even as you know very well it isn’t. Having no direct insight into
the “inner mental life” of models, we claim that every false fact they spit out
is a form of hallucination. The meaning of the word is shifting from the medical
sense towards the direction of “just being wrong, and persistently so”. This has
plagued human speech for centuries. As a convenient example, look up some heated
debate between proponents of science and those of religion. (As if the two need
be in conflict!) When a model exhibits hallucination, often providing more
context and evidence will dispel it, but the same trick does not appear to work
so well on humans.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Where to go from here? One conclusion is that LLMs are damaging the connection
people feel with each other, much like a decade before social networks
threatened to destroy it by replacing it with a shallower, simulated versions.
Another interpretation would be to conclude cynically that it’s time humans get
either enhanced or replaced by a more powerful form of intelligence. I’d say
we’re not there yet entirely, but that some of the replacement has been effected
already: I’ll never again ask a human to write a computer program shorter than
about a thousand lines, since an LLM will do it better.</p>
<p>Indeed, why am I even writing this? I asked GPT-5 for additional failure modes
and found more additional examples than I could hope to get from a human:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Beyond the failure modes already discussed, humans also exhibit analogues of
several newer LLM pathologies: conversations often suffer from <strong>instruction
drift,</strong> where the original goal quietly decays as social momentum takes over;
<strong>mode collapse,</strong> in which people fall back on a small set of safe clichés
and conversational templates; and <strong>reward hacking,</strong> where social approval or
harmony is optimized at the expense of truth or usefulness. Humans frequently
<strong>overfit the prompt,</strong> responding to the literal wording rather than the
underlying intent, and display <strong>safety overrefusal,</strong> declining to engage
with reasonable questions to avoid social or reputational risk. Reasoning is
also marked by <strong>inconsistency across turns,</strong> with contradictions going
unnoticed, and by <strong>temperature instability,</strong> where fatigue, emotion, or
audience dramatically alters the quality and style of thought from one moment
to the next.</p>

<h2><a href="build-linux-for-stm32mp135-in-under-50-lines-of-makefile">Build Linux for STM32MP135 in under 50 Lines of Makefile</a></h2>
<div class="article-meta">Published 6 Jan 2026. By Jakob Kastelic.</div>
<p><img alt="" src="../images/rain.jpg"/></p>
<p><em>This is Part 7 in the series: Linux on STM32MP135. <a href="#series-list">See other
articles.</a></em></p>
<p>In the <a href="https://embd.cc/linux-bringup-on-custom-stm32mp135-board">previous
article</a> we took a
<a href="https://github.com/js216/stm32mp135_test_board">custom STM32MP135 board</a> from a
simple LED blink to passing the kernel early boot stage, printing the “Booting
Linux” message. Now, it’s time to finish the kernel initialization all the way
up to running our first process: the <code>init</code> process.</p>
<p>We’ll do it in two steps. First, we make it run on the official <a href="https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/stm32mp135f-dk.html">evaluation
board</a> for the SoC.
In a future article, we will consider what needs to be changed in order to make
this work on a <a href="https://github.com/js216/stm32mp135_test_board">custom board</a>.</p>
<h3 id="boot-linux-on-eval-board">Boot Linux on eval board</h3>
<p>First, we need to obtain and build the bootloader. Note that we need to enable
the STPMIC1, since it is used on the eval board:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><code class="language-sh">git clone git@github.com:js216/stm32mp135-bootloader.git
cd stm32mp135-bootloader
make CFLAGS_EXTRA=-DUSE_STPMIC1x=1
cd ..</code></pre></div>
<p>Next, we obtain the Linux kernel from the ST repository (contains a few
non-standard ST-provided drivers):</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><code class="language-sh">git clone https://github.com/STMicroelectronics/linux.git
git checkout v6.1-stm32mp-r1.1</code></pre></div>
<p>Let’s apply some patches (mainly to allow non-secure boot without
<a href="https://embd.cc/stm32mp135-without-u-boot">U-Boot</a>,
<a href="https://embd.cc/stm32mp135-without-optee">OPTEE</a>, or
<a href="https://embd.cc/linux-bringup-on-custom-stm32mp135-board">TF-A</a>), and copy over
the Device Tree Source (DTS), and the kernel configuration:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><code class="language-sh">git clone git@github.com:js216/stm32mp135_test_board.git

cd linux
git linux apply ../configs/evb/patches/linux/*.patch
cd ..

cp config/evb/linux.config linux/.config
cp config/evb/board.dts linux/arch/arm/boot/dts/</code></pre></div>
<p>Now we can build the Device Tree Blob (DTB) and the kernel itself:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><code class="language-sh">cd linux
make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabihf- board.dtb
make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabihf- zImage
cd ..</code></pre></div>
<p>Next, we need an init script. (Of course, you can also run the kernel without
it, but be prepared for a kernel panic at the end of the boot, telling you the
init is missing.) An init script can be essentially any program, even a “Hello,
world!”, but if the init program quits, the kernel enters a panic again.</p>
<p>I asked AI to write a minimal init, without any C standard library dependencies
(find the result
<a href="https://github.com/js216/stm32mp135_test_board/blob/main/configs/evb/init.c">here</a>).
Let’s compile it, making sure to tell the compiler to not link any extra code
with it:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><code class="language-sh">arm-linux-gnueabihf-gcc -Os -nostdlib -static -fno-builtin \
   -Wl,--gc-sections config/init.c -o build/init</code></pre></div>
<p>Now that we have an init program, we need a root filesystem to put it on:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><code class="language-sh">mkdir -p build/rootfs.dir/sbin
cp build/init build/rootfs.dir/sbin/init
dd if=/dev/zero of=build/rootfs bs=1M count=10
mke2fs -t ext4 -F -d build/rootfs.dir build/rootfs</code></pre></div>
<p>Finally, we collect all the pieces together with a simple Python script included
in the bootloader distribution:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><code class="language-sh">python3 bootloader/scripts/sdimage.py build/sdcard.img \
   bootloader/build/main.stm32 \
   linux/arch/arm/boot/dts/board.dtb \
   linux/arch/arm/boot/zImage \
   --partition build/rootfs</code></pre></div>
<p>Write this image to the SD card and start the system, and prepare to be greeted
by the very useless shell implemented in the minimal
<a href="https://github.com/js216/stm32mp135_test_board/blob/main/configs/evb/init.c">init program</a>):</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><code class="language-sh">[    1.940577] Run /sbin/init as init process
Hello, world!
$ ls
ls: command not found
$ Hey!
Hey!: command not found</code></pre></div>
<p>That’s it!</p>
<h3 id="the-makefile">The Makefile</h3>
<p>Here’s the full 49 lines:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><code class="language-makefile">CONFIG_DIR := configs/custom

<h3 id="discussion">Discussion</h3>
<p>The Makefile that reproduces the steps above is less than 50 lines long and
creates a minimal, bootable SD card image in a very straightforward way: build
the kernel, the DTB, and a userspace program (init), and package everything into
a single SD card image. The next simplest thing to accomplish the same result is
the “lightweight” <a href="https://buildroot.org/">Buildroot</a>, which needs nearly 100k
lines of make. What could possibly be happening in all that code!?</p>
<p>The sentiment
has been captured by the Reddit user <code>triffid_hunter</code> in a recent
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/embedded/comments/1pqg3ty/embedded_systems_are_really_hard_to_learn">comment</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I find that the hardest part about embedded is the horrendously obtuse
manufacturer-provided toolchains.</p>
<p>If I can find a way to ditch them and switch to gcc+Makefile+basic C
libraries, that’s the first thing I’ll do.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Buildroot is a relatively clean solution to the problem of supporting a huge
number of packages on a wide variety of boards, but most of that complexity is
not needed for a single-board project. (Yocto is an even more complex system,
which we won’t cover here—its simplicity for the user comes at the cost of
massive implementation complexity.) From my point of view, all these hundreds of
thousands of lines of code are simply “accidental complexity” as articulated by
ESR:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Accidental complexity happens because someone didn’t find the simplest way to
 implement a specified set of features. Accidental complexity can be
 eliminated by good design, or good redesign.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn-ab35ed71-acc" id="fnref-ab35ed71-acc">[1]</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The “root cause” of the highly complex toolchains has been identified by
Anna-Lena Marx (inovex GmbH) in a talk<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn-ab35ed71-talk" id="fnref-ab35ed71-talk">[2]</a></sup> last year: the goals of SoC
vendors and product manufacturers are not aligned. The SoC vendor wants to show
off all the features of their devices, and they want a Board Support Package
(BSP) that supports several, even all, of the devices in their portfolio. They
want a “turnkey solution” that allows an engineer to go from nothing to a
full-featured demo in ten minutes.</p>
<p>In contrast, a product manufacturer who wants to use embedded Linux in their
application-specific product wants a minimal software stack, as close as
possible to the upstream stable versions in order to be stable, secure, &amp;
maintainable. It’s the difference between merely using the system, and owning
it.</p>
<p>From the product side, I can concur that the SoC BSPs can be a nightmare to work
with! They are simple to get started with, being a packaged “turnkey solution”,
but require a massive amount of work to unpeel all the abstraction layers that
the SoC vendor found necessary to support their entire ecosystem of devices. ST,
being perhaps the most “hacker friendly” vendor, likely has the cleanest, most
“upstreamed” offering, and still there’s loads of cruft that must be removed
before getting to something workable.</p>
<p>I would like a world where SoC vendors ship their product with simple,
straightforward <em>documentation</em>, rather than monolithic code examples. Give me
the smallest possible building blocks and tell me how to connect them together
to accomplish something, rather than give the huge all-in-one example code that
can take many tens of hours to pull apart and reassemble. In other words, I
expect a Linux distribution to approach to the ideal of <a href="https://embd.cc/unix-contributions">Unix
philosophy</a> much more closely, all the more
so in an embedded, resource-constrained, highly reliable application.</p>

<h2><a href="agent-to-read-datasheets">Agent To Read Electronic Datasheets</a></h2>
<div class="article-meta">Published 2 Jan 2026. By Jakob Kastelic.</div>
<p><img alt="" src="../images/pa.jpg"/></p>
<p>When an electronic design company accumulates large amounts of inventory, it can
become overwhelming for engineers to go through the thousands of parts to find
the one needed in a new design. Instead, they are likely to select a new part
from one of the distributors that have a better search engine. This leads to an
ever growing inventory: parts kept in stock and never used, a constant departure
from the ideal of having a “lean” operation.</p>
<p>Nowadays, with everyone creating their own “agent” for just about anything, I
wondered how hard it would be to create my own search engine. This article
represents a day of work, proving that structured data extraction from
semi-unstructured sources like datasheets has become almost a trivial problem.</p>
<p>I took the <a href="https://deepmind.google/models/gemma/gemma-3/">Gemma 3</a> model (12B
parameters, 3-bit quantization) from Google, ran it in the
<a href="https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp">llama.cpp</a> inference framework, and fed
it the datasheet for an opamp. To extract the text from the PDFs, I used the
<a href="https://www.docling.ai/">Docling</a> Python library from IBM research. The output,
generated in about four minutes on a GPU with 8 GB of memory, will be in this
format for now:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><code class="language-json">"PSRR (Input offset voltage versus power supply)": {
   "min": 65,
   "typ": 100,
   "max": null,
   "unit": "dB"
 },</code></pre></div>
<p>Let’s get started!</p>
<h3 id="running-the-model">Running the model</h3>
<p>Obtain and build llama.cpp:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><code class="language-sh">git clone https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp
cd llama.cpp
cmake -B build -S . -DGGML_CUDA=ON
cmake --build build -j</code></pre></div>
<p>Obtain the <a href="https://huggingface.co/bartowski/google_gemma-3-12b-it-GGUF">Gemma
3</a> model.</p>
<p>Start the LLM server:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><code class="language-sh">llama-server -m ~/temp/gemma-3-12b-it-UD-IQ3_XXS.gguf \
   --port 8080 -c 4096 -ngl 999</code></pre></div>
<p>Open <code>localhost:8080</code> and feel free to chat with the model. How simple things
have become!</p>
<h3 id="get-datasheet-text">Get datasheet text</h3>
<p>Next, we need to convert the datasheets from the PDF format into plain text that
we can feed to the model. Assuming <code>docling</code> is installed (install it with Pip
if not), we can define the following function to convert the documents:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><code class="language-python"><span class="k">import</span> sys
<span class="k">from</span> pathlib <span class="k">import</span> Path
<span class="k">from</span> docling.document_converter <span class="k">import</span> DocumentConverter

<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">convert_pdf_to_markdown</span>(pdf_file):
    pdf_path <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nf">Path</span>(pdf_file)
    converter <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nf">DocumentConverter</span>()
    result <span class="o">=</span> converter.<span class="nf">convert</span>(pdf_path)
    content <span class="o">=</span> result.document.<span class="nf">export_to_markdown</span>()
    <span class="nf">print</span>(content)</code></pre></div>
<p>This yields the output in a Markdown format.</p>
<h3 id="define-agent-with-a-simple-prompt">Define agent with a simple prompt</h3>
<p>Here’s the best part: the “source code” for the agent is in plain English. Here
it is in its entirety:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><code class="language-text">You are a datasheet specification extraction agent. Your
only job is to extract specifications.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
{
  "Full parameter name (short name)": {
    "min": number or null,
    "typ": number or null,
    "max": number or null,
    "unit": "string"
  }
}

EXTRACTION RULES:
- Always include both the full and short spec name in the key.
- Full name goes first, and short name in brackets: "Operating Temperature (T)"
- If a typ value is a range like "-11.5 to 14.5", split it: min=-11.5, max=14.5
- Convert scientific notation: "10 12" → 1e12
- Convert ± values into min/max fields
- Omit parameters with no numeric values (all null)
- Omit footnotes like (1) and (2)
- If no specifications exist, return: {}

CRITICAL OUTPUT RULES:
- Return ONLY valid JSON
- NO explanations
- NO descriptions
- NO phrases like "this section", "no specifications", "I will skip"
- NO text before or after the JSON
- NO markdown code blocks
- Just the raw JSON object</code></pre></div>
<p>The insistence on pure JSON is a hack to make it stop being too chatty. There’s
probably a more sophisticated way to do it, but for a first attempt it’ll do
just fine.</p>
<h3 id="chunking">”Chunking”</h3>
<p>The datasheet conversion from PDF includes lots of unnecessary text like
document version information, copyright, ordering information. For now, we’d
like to get just the electronic specifications. As a first approximation, assume
that the information is always present in tables only.</p>
<p>ChatGPT assures me that the following regex magic will extract tables from a
Markdown document:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><code class="language-python"><span class="k">import</span> re

<h3 id="putting-it-together">Putting it together</h3>
<p>We have all the pieces now: text data in small pieces, a model, the prompt to
define an agent. Now just iterate over all the chunks as defined above, send
them to the model together with the prompt, and observe what comes out. To
automate the process from PDF to the final JSON, I used a Makefile defining the
recipes for the three steps of the transformation. All of this is too
straightforward to be worth including here.</p>

<h2><a href="emptiness-constraint-actually-doing-things">On Emptiness, Constraint, and Doing Things</a></h2>
<div class="article-meta">Published 23 Dec 2025. By Jakob Kastelic and GPT-5.</div>
<p><img alt="" src="../images/roy.jpg"/></p>
<p>There’s a <a href="https://embd.cc/limitation-is-freedom">recurring</a> paradox in life:
when forced into constraint—normally in the office—it’s easy to get a
surprising amount of work done. When free—at home, with a desk full of
possibilities—I do almost nothing. Probably most people have felt this:
paralyzed by options, not liberated by freedom.</p>
<p>In the office, there’s a clear system. Hours, tasks, deadlines. None of these
promise joy or meaning. You just show up, pick the thing that needs to be done,
and do it. Often it’s boring, sometimes hard, sometimes fun—but mostly it’s
ordinary execution. And it gets done, the meaning/joy shows up later, if it
does. In other words, meaning is retrospective, not prospective.</p>
<h3 id="the-problem">The Problem</h3>
<p>At home, when anyone could be the architect of their own life—at least in
theory—everything feels like a potential project rather than a commitment.
There’s a long list of things to do someday. You start something, lose
interest, start something else, lose interest there too. The pile grows. The
mind feels like a full cup, overflowing, useless as a vessel since it has no
volume available. I had a lot of energy running toward the possibility of
things, and none toward actually doing any of them.</p>
<p>There are all these things to do, but when the time came, I would just scroll
through random websites and stuff.  Not for lack of desire but because every
possibility was simultaneously “urgent” and none had any context, boundary, or
commitment. I was waiting for the meaning to arrive—expecting to feel it
first, and act second. A kind of dopamine-before-action loop that never
materializes, because dopamine isn’t a starting signal; it’s a reward signal
after progress has been made.</p>
<p>I recently realized this was not a motivational problem but a structural one.
The <code>ideas.txt</code> file, where the latest projects and ideas get stored, was
effectively a home version of what at work would be called <code>unnecessary.txt</code>: a
repository of work items that don’t currently need attention (see <a href="https://embd.cc/yes-no-productivity">this
article</a> for more on this approach). But
because at home all of those things are regarded as “alive”, they were
cluttering the “mental desk”, competing for attention and claiming emotional
validity. This is exactly how productivity systems fail: they mistake interest
with execution rights. You think something is alive because you wrote it down.
That creates mental load.</p>
<p>So I enforced a constraint.</p>
<h3 id="a-solution-one-hobby-at-a-time">A Solution: One Hobby at a Time</h3>
<p>I adapted this: Only one productive leisure project gets execution rights at a
time. The rest become cold archive—”not right now, maybe later.” They live in
<code>ideas.txt</code>, not in the working memory.</p>
<p>This is not suppression of curiosity. It’s admission control, a bit like the WIP
limits (the kanban-style work in progress caps, see below) that enforce unity of
purpose and prevent jamming the “system” with too many requirements.</p>
<p>The curious thing: once all the other activities besides the “One Hobby” became
off-limits to tracking and obligation, they lost their psychological “landmine”
quality. They became playful again, instead of competing for real estate in the
head. Then they were constantly evaluated, compared, prioritized—a swarm of
partial commitments without form or finish.</p>
<h3 id="productive-vs-restorative-leisure">Productive vs Restorative Leisure</h3>
<p>That distinction matters.</p>
<p>Productive Leisure is an activity that:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>can be tracked for progress,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>has future implications or expectations,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>competes for mental slots,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>produces artifacts, skill growth, or structured outcomes.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These are the things that can fill up the mind if left unconstrained.</p>
<p>In contrast, restorative Leisure is play without future stakes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>no tracking,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>no backlog,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>no scorecards,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>activities done for their own sake.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Once Productive Leisure items were formally demoted to “cold archive unless
active,” many of them felt like Restorative Leisure: something you might do
because it’s pleasant, not something you have to do to avoid guilt or loss.</p>
<p>This distinction mirrors the essence of constraint in productivity: by making
clear what counts and what doesn’t, you reduce the cognitive load of
decision-making and let intentional action happen.</p>
<h3 id="kanban">Kanban</h3>
<p>Kanban, in its original form at Toyota, was a simple, physical system for
managing production flow on the factory floor using cards that each represented
permission to produce or move a specific part. Rather than relying on schedules,
forecasts, or manager oversight, kanban used these tangible cards to regulate
when work could start and when it could move forward. The system naturally
enforced limits on how much unfinished work could exist at any moment.</p>
<p>The key irony is that the system makes work more productive by <em>preventing</em>
work, that is, an excess of work. Each step in the production line is governed
by a small number of physical kanban cards, and a task cannot move forward
unless a card is available. It recognizes that no worker or process has infinite
capacity and it helps no one to pretend otherwise. Bottlenecks become visible
immediately, there is no illusion of productivity or busy-work, queues cannot
silently grow, and problems are forced to surface where they actually occur.</p>
<p>Fewer parallel tasks means less context switching, faster feedback, and higher
quality, since defects were discovered close to their source. Crucially, kanban
does not rely on motivation, discipline, or managerial pressure; it embedded
restraint directly into the environment. The tokens made overcommitment
impossible, and in doing so created the emptiness in which steady, reliable work
could actually happen.</p>
<h3 id="taoist-emptiness-and-functional-capacity">Taoist Emptiness and Functional Capacity</h3>
<p>I was struck by how this aligned with a very old idea: the usefulness of
emptiness:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I do my utmost to attain emptiness; I hold firmly to stillness. The myriad
creatures all rise together And I watch their return. [Tao Te Ching, 16]</p>
<p>The way never acts yet nothing is left undone. [37]</p>
<p>The Master does nothing, yet he leaves nothing undone. The ordinary man is
always doing things, yet many more are left to be done. [38]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Taoists observed that a cup is useful because it is empty; a room is useful
because it has space. When something gets completely full, it loses its
usefulness. The same applied to the “mental desk”: when it was totally full of
half-alive things, it became rigid, dead, and useless.</p>
<p>In this emptiness—not the absence of goals, but the absence of competing
commitments—things can actually happen. You don’t wait for meaning; you let
meaning emerge from action.</p>
<p>”The Way does nothing, yet leaves nothing undone.” Action arises unforced when
the system isn’t cluttered with demands, comparisons, and anticipation.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>The system distilled down to a simple invariant:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Only one productive leisure activity is alive in the present.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Everything else is archived.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Restorative activities are permissionless.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Progress, not aspiration, drives meaning.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In other words, <em>interest does not grant execution rights</em>. Execution rights
must be scarce, just like kanban tokens. When they are, things get done; when
they’re abundant, nothing happens.</p>
<p>In this system, willpower or motivation became almost irrelevant. When the mind
is freed from the need to do “everything”, the intention can take over. This
kind of intentional action, in my experience, only works when there’s very few
intentions to compete with each other.</p>
<p>Emptiness isn’t the absence of desires. It’s the absence of conflicting claims
on your attention. Start there, and you can actually practice something.</p>
